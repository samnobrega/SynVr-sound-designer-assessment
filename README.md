## Design choices

Overall I tried to bring lightness and delicacy in the choices made with the sounds, textures and timbres used.

For the sound effects I used some sounds that I had recorded myself as ambience and footsteps, mixed with some sounds available in the Soundly application. With this mixture (sound layers), it is possible to create more authentic sound textures.

Considering the proposal that the app would aim to distract the user during a painful procedure, I chose to follow an aesthetic path in the music as if I were chanting a mantra, keeping a static harmonic pattern and with few melodic variations. This way the listener tends to enter in a vibratory frequency along with the music and tends to slow down the heartbeat and consequently relaxing mind and body.
